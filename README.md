# Algorithms-and-Applications-in-Social-Networks

Today we cannot imagine our life without social networks. <br/>
The interest in analyzing social networks, their structure, predicting expected behavior of the users in social networks increased in the past years.  <br/>
This course will focus on social networks and especially online social networks, bringing together both algorithms (from "classic" to recent state-of-the-art) and applications for these networks. <br/>
The course will involve both theoretical parts (such as formal definition of social network, measurements in social networks, network formation, community detection algorithms and more) and practical parts (including hands-on programming using Python and libraries such as NetworkX). <br/>
In addition to covering fundamental issues in social networks, we will focus on practical real world tasks, including the trends from the last years.  <br/>
For practice, we will use publically available datasets of social networks and demonstrate solution of real life challenges. <br/>
